# Choose an option from below (percentage or absolute)
# With percentage, a relative amount of players needs to sleep (eg. needed: 30 -> 13 online players, 30% of 13 is 3,9. Will be rounded to the nearest number -> 4 sleeping players needed)
# With absolute, a static amount of players needs to sleep (eg. needed: 2 -> any amount of online players, 2 players need to sleep)
sleeper_calculator: "percentage"

# This depends on your sleeper_calculator setting
#     Percentage: This value is the percentage of players in a world that must sleep ([0, 100])
#     Absolute: This value is always the amount of players that must sleep, does not scale with the amount of online players!
needed: 30
