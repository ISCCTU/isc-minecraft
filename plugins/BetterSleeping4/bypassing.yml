# Players with bypass permissions WILL be counted towards the sleeping count
# They can get buffs if they sleep but not sleeping won't give them debuffs
# How to give bypass permissions? (meeting one of the requirements below is enough)
#     - Give permission bettersleeping.bypass
#     - Give permission essentials.sleepingingored (will only work if Essentials is installed on your server)
#     - Ignore a game mode in the list below and be in that gamemode

# Here you can choose whether or not you want BetterSleeping to ignore players with each gamemode
ignore_survival: false
ignore_creative: false
ignore_adventure: false
ignore_spectator: true
